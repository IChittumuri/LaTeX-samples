Any introductory text goes here. If there is none, delete this line and the line below it.\\
\\
\textbf{Claim:} Your claim goes here.\\
\textbf{Proof:} Your proof goes here. Math stuff that you want in the line of text goes in between single dollar signs. LOOK: $S=\{x\in\R:\forall a\in \N, \exists b\in \Z, \frac{x}{a-b}\in\Q\}$. Math stuff you want to put centered on its own line goes in between double dollar signs. Clearly,
$$A\subseteq B\cap(C\cup D)\iff (A\subseteq B)\land ((A\subseteq C)\lor (A\subseteq D)).$$
This is how you cite something \cite{ReferenceLabel1}.
When you are done with your proof you get to make a solid or open square. $\bs$ $\square$
